# What it does

- It is a game I though after programming the counter letters game.
- Basically you received a chess position and you have to give how many valid moves has the next player.
- You can program difficulty by defining how many positions and how many pieces over the boards you want.
- It has more than 8000 positions randomly generated (simulating chess games with random valid movements, which I did in my chess_positions_rb project). I would like to provide more positions but free Heroku don't let me =(.
- You need to login. No need to provide a real email.
- It provides some stats about your performance, best scores and recent scores.
